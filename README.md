# Simple express app wrapped in Docker

This was to demonstrate how to create a Docker image, container, and volumes from a simple app.

`docker ps` 
Shows containers that are running.

`docker build -t myimagename:1.0.1`
Builds a docker image from the Dockerfile in the curerent folder using tag "myimagename:1.0.1.

`docker run -p 5050:8080 myimagename:1.0.1`
Runs the docker image.

`docker run -p 5050:8080 -v /Users/myuser/code/myproject/:/src/ myimagename:1.0.1`
Runs docker image with volume mapped to local folder.

`docker kill 123`
Kills the container with an ID starting with 123. The name generated by Docker can also be used to identify the container you would like to kill.
